# Onboarding a new maintainer to a project

Check the [GOVERANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md) file for requisites and
responsibilities to appoint a new maintainer to a project.

## Tasks for onboarding the new maintainer

1. **Add them to the GitHub Team.** Add them to the `{project}-maintainers`
   team so they can have writing permissions over the relevant repository.
1. **Add them to PyPI and TestPyPI.** Find the project in PyPI and TestPyPI and
   invite them as Maintainer.
1. **Add them to Zenodo.** Go to the [Fatiando a Terra
   community](https://zenodo.org/communities/fatiando/) in Zenodo and add the
   new member as **Curator**.
1. Make the new maintainer aware of these invitations, since most of them
   expire after a few days.
1. Ensure that they are using standard security IT measurements, like:
   * using a password manager,
   * setting strong passwords,
   * using a 2FA in GitHub and PyPI,
   * not repeating the passwords elsewhere.
