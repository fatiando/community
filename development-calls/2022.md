--------------------------------------------------------------

## 2022-05-27

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Leo
- Santi
- Mariana
- Lu

**Discussion points:**

- Grid method in Harmonica equivalent sources
    - It raises the Verde FutureWarning for future deprecation of the `shape`, `region` and `spacing` arguments, in favor of using `coordinates`.
    - Should we deprecate those directly in Harmonica?
    - https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/311
    - Remove it! Mariana can put a pop up note on the video tutorials warning people about the change.
- Idea: Split our current tutorial in 3-4 20 min chunks to make it easier to re-record.
- Mariana suggested always mentioning the version of packages and year when starting a recording. Point people to where they find the most up-to-date information.
- Merging season in Harmonica!
    - Upward derivatives with FFT [#238](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/238)
        - Ready to go!
        - Bug in `xrft` when arrays have `upward` coordinates, but we will solve it upstream.
        - Need to get some data for examples: https://github.com/fatiando-data/.github/issues/12
        - Rename freq domain filter functions to `derivative_upward_kernel`
        - Every filter could live inside their own `transformations.py` file (both spatial domain and filter kernels)
    - isostatic_moho_airy [#307](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/307)
        - Rename function to `isostatic_moho_airy`
        - Don't bother to recover the `isostasy_airy`
        - Test if density arrays work as well
        - Check coverage
- Enforcing private subpackages:
    - https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/314
- Harmonica User guide [#305](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/305):
    - Will try to merge sooner than later
    - Collaborations will be **very** welcomed!
    - Ideas:
        - remove the _This software is in the early stages of design and implementation_ warning or change it a little bit
        - I think this spooks people out
        - Change it to green (not so alarming), rephrase to "ready to be used but still changing"
        - Adapting to user feedback, positive side of "still changing"

## 2022-05-20

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Agustina
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Plotting blocks from verde.BlockReduce
    - Understanding k-d trees
    - From block centers to `matplotlib.patches.Rectangle`
- Remove point_mass_gravity function [#310](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/310)
    - Need to remove unused `warnings` import and ready to be merged! ðŸŽ‰
- Boule: Add example to calculate the global gravity disturbance [#102](https://github.com/fatiando/boule/pull/102)
    - GitHub Actions need to use conda for building docs since we are using GMT
 
 
## 2022-05-13

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Federico
- Leo
- Lu
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- T-shirts! https://softwareunderground.org/shop
- Software Underground as fiscal sponsor
    - Read Matt's post
- Live coding a basement depth gravity inversion :female-technologist:. The [video recording of this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqhvjhpHo6I) was uploaded in Youtube by Mariana 
- New Airy isostasy function by Lu! (https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/307)
    - New approach to make it more general
    - `basement` argument (height/depth to crystalyne basement)
    - `layers` dict: supports multiple layers (e.g. sedimens, water, ice). We need to pass thickness and density. Both thickness and density could be arrays!
    - Should we break backward compatiblity?
        - moho_depth_airy?
        - isostatic_moho_airy
    - Add support for variable density for the crust (docstring + tests)
    - Add deprecation warning for `isostasy_airy`
    - PendingDeprecation warning instead FutureWarning
    - This would be really cool paired with a oceanic crust density model as a function of age
        - This type of calculation is useful for Moho gravity inversion as well in the ocean
        - Leo has code for the cooling models from a class. Maybe put that into a cooling model package.
        - Which then requires a good package name (suggestions please!)


## 2022-05-06

        - Topography grid of Southern Africa at full ETOPO1 resolution
- A lot happening in Harmonica
    - Drop support for Python 3.6 ([#309](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/309))
    - Computation of tensor components for point sources ([#288](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/288))
    - Lu opened a PR for a more general Airy isostasy function :muscle: 
        - Instead of topography + bathymetry, works with crystaline basement and thicknesses of the layers
    - FFT domains:
        - Upward derivative + fft filters framework soon to be merged ([#307](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/307))
        - After that, we will include every filter that Lu wrote on [#299](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/307)
        - Bug in `xrft.pad` when passing a DataArray with `upward` coordinate as 2D array. Need to report and fix it.
    - Applying FFT to a profile (1D):
        - We can use numpy for it
        - Might worth checking if we can do it with `xrft` (it should work)

## 2022-04-22

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Gelson
- Lu
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Santi is working on a new face for Harmonica docs!
    - Make topgoraphic correction a toctree. Then include one section for BOuguer correction and one for forward modelling the topography.
    - Include instructions to convert geoid heights to ellipsoid heights.
    - Cut south africa gravity to Bushveld area. Upload a bushveld gravity dataset to Ensaio. Upload a topography grid for Bushveld.
- Using Ensaio in Harmonica
    - We will deprecate `datasets` module in v0.6.0
    - The new docs will use ensaio for getting sample datasets
    - Should we keep synthetic surveys (ensaio would be an optional dependency, not required)?
        - Just ditch them.
- Merging prisms to PyVista PR (https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/291)
    - Should we make `harmonica.visualization.prism_to_pyvista` public? Should we create a new `visualization` module?
        - Make it a module and make the `prisms_to_pyvista` function public.
    - CIs won't pass because codecov will complain on a reduction of coverage: we cannot test if the `if pyvista: ...; except: ...;` works to reach 100% coverage. Can we mock it?
- Change Airy Isostatic based on RET?
	- More flexable
	- https://nbviewer.org/github/LL-Geo/PFToolbox/blob/master/Airy_Isostatic.ipynb
    - Awesome job! Lu will open a PR.
        - Take a single `layers` that could be a dictionary. Each element of it should be a tuple of (`thickness`, `density`).
        - How to pass the basement?
        - test against simple airy cases.



## 2022-04-15

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Santi
- Lu

**Discussion points:**

- Harmonica docs are getting a new face (PR coming soon)
    - Use sphinx panels as Pooch and Verde
    - Create a User Guide with explainatory pages of the tools in Harmonica
    - Planning to ditch gallery example
        - Instead, write RST files and use `jupyter-sphinx` to run blocks of code while building
        - We will be able to generate PyVista 3D plots with `jupyter-sphinx`.
        - API Reference could be a single list, maybe we don't need to split it in so many categories
- Yet another talk about isostasy
    - Idea: general function that computes isostasy taking equivalent topographic load.
        - Might need another tool to build the topographic load from a given geological setup.
    - Flexure
        - It could be an fft filter
- Talk proposal to RSECon about Pooch. Anyone wants to help?
- Bug in xrft regarding padding
    - Lu opened an issue
    - Santi will try to solve it!
- FFTs in Harmonica:
    - Merge Lu and Santi PRs:
        - Santi will bring the design based in building functions instead of classes
        - Lu has already implemented a lot of filters!
    - Add padding by default?
    - Test functions against numerical results might have edge effects if we don't apply padding
        - Test with padding
        - Test without padding and crop the area to compare

**For next week**

- Revise author order criteria (https://github.com/fatiando/community/pull/53)``


## 2022-04-01

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Leo
- Mariana
- Gelson
- Federico

**Discussion points:**

- Update on using Jupyter Book to make our tutorials into a website: https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/issues/4
    - Mariana built a prototype book and it looks great! There is an error when downloading some of the data but not sure why.
    - Next steps:
        - Remove the unnecessary template files
        - Move configuration to the base of the repository (instead of a separate `jupyter-book` folder)
        - Add jupyter-book to the `environment.yml` file
        - Open an PR adding the configuration
        - After that, add a GitHub Actions to build and push the HTML to gh-pages
            - See this example that Leo made: https://github.com/leouieda/jb-test
            - That site is served at https://www.leouieda.com/jb-test/intro.html
- Leo is off on vacation next week so won't be at the meeting

## 2022-03-25

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Youtube recording:** https://youtu.be/JNMcMuMYn8E

**Participants** 

- Leo
- Mariana
- Gelson
- Federico

**Discussion points:**

- Releasing Verde 1.7.0 live!
    - Leo walked through the process of making a release of Verde.
    - Mariana contributed some questions about the process that highlighted a few areas of improvement:
        -  Manual editing of the log to remove commit hashes, dates, etc, could probably be automated with a smarter [git shortlog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog) command
        - How we order authors is a bit arbitrary (commit number) and requires manual updating all the time. **Should we just use "Fatiando a Terra Project" as the first author and list everyone alphabetically?**
    - Had some trouble with the GitHub Actions jobs not being triggered by the release. Deleting the release and making it again on GitHub fixed the issue (see https://github.com/fatiando/verde/actions?query=event%3Arelease)
    - Links:
        - Release checklist issue: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/issues/341
        - Zenodo archive: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6384887
        - GitHub release: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/releases/tag/v1.7.0
        - PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/verde/1.7.0/ (automatically built and uploaded by this https://github.com/fatiando/verde/actions/runs/2040766671)
        - New documentation: https://www.fatiando.org/verde/v1.7.0 (automatically built and uploaded by https://github.com/fatiando/verde/actions/runs/2040766672)
    - Recorded the session and posted to YouTube (thanks Mariana).
    

## 2022-03-18

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Lu
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Harmonica maintenance:
    - Improve packaging by moving from `setup.py` to `setup.cfg`. Thanks Leo!
    - Trying to extend support to Python 3.10 :crossed_fingers:
        - Fixing issues with old version of sphinx
- Little bit of talk about Transform22 tutorial
- Details for future TeseroidLayer implementation
    - Converting grids in ellipsoidal coordinates to spherical coordinates
        - What to do with latitude and spherical latitude?
            - Resample
            - Assume the same
    - TesseroidLayer in the poles
        - Tesseroids are like triangles or trapezoids near the poles
        - Grids around the pole have different "resolutions" depending on the latitude
        - Possible future test: compare computations on the pole vs the same layer rotated to the equator.

## 2022-03-11

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- India
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Getting to know each other. Where and in what are we doing the PhD?
- We talked about some aspects that make it easier to contribute to the different repositories:
    1. Santiago explained that Fatiando does not use [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) because it has different problems.
    1. Understanding what `make` does and what a Makefile is.
    1. The importance of being added to the list of [authors](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/AUTHORSHIP.md).
    1. Using [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/) to be able to see the differences between notebooks more clearly.




## 2022-03-04

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Andrea
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Worked in parallel for ~45mins on different PRs
    - Santi: the new `prisms_to_pyvista` feature
    - Mariana: implement usage of Ensaio in Harmonica
- Some pair programming on the `prisms_to_pyvista` PR (https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/291)
    - How we can read pytest results
    - How can we debug the issues raised by them
    - Differences between `np.array` and `np.asarray`:
        - `np.array` always create a new array
        - `np.asarray` converts the input to array only if necesary (more efficient if we already know that the input might be an array in some cases)
- Dicussions on moving gallery example of Harmonica into tutorial pages
    - Explainations inside code comments in gallery example are aweful :face_vomiting: 
    - Move some of the gallery examples to their own document pages
        - They should have engaging names:
            - s/Gradient-boosted equivalent sources/Gridding very large datasets/
    - Andrea: make the prism layer 3D plot interactive with PyVista.


## 2022-02-25

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Lu
- Mariana
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Installing fatiando-legacy under Windows
    - python2.7 executable needs execution permissions!
    - Numpy 1.11.3 worked! Test passed! :tada:
- Answering questions in Slack might need more thought on context
    - What are they trying to do?
    - What geo problem they are trying to solve?
    - Idea: add instructions on "how to ask help in Slack"
        - Maybe in the Slack Welcoming bot
        - Thanks Mariana!
        - See "Asking for assistance subject matter expert" by Michael Pyrcz (see below)
- Slack messages get lost in time
    - Maybe a forum would be the best solution for the future (if the community grows too much)


> ### Asking for Assistance from a Subject Matter Expert
> 
> Michael Pyrcz, University of Texas at Austin (@GeostatsGuy)
> 
> Everyday I get multiple e-mails from individuals, that I have never met, asking
> for assistance. Most of the time these communications follow this pattern:
> 
> _"Greetings, I really enjoy your [insert specific online content]. [insert multiple requests for assistance]. Thank you, [insert name]'_
> 
> I've often asked for and received help from the scientific community. I feel
> that science is a social activity, but I think there is an opportunity to
> provide feedback on how improve the chance of success while building a network.
> Here's some ideas on **cold contact with a subject matter expert (SME)**.
> 
> **Introduce Yourself** - _provide a good introduction_.
> Go beyond your name by providing your affiliation, and then link your work to
> the topic of interest for the SME. This is an opportunity to build your network
> while self-advocating. You clearly know the SME, let them know you and make the
> SME more comfortable to respond.
> 
> **Do Your Research** - _put significant effort into finding your own solutions and demonstrate this_.
> The SME is not your help desk, even the most patient individual will fatigue
> with questions that indicate that little effort has been made to research the
> problem. We match your energy.
> 
> **Just Share Appreciation** - _consider just communicating appreciation_.
> There is an amazing amount of effort and time involved to provide content to
> the community. Yet, it is rare to only receive a message of appreciation
> without a request. You have no idea how it warms our hearts to hear about your
> success with our contentl We lift each other.
> 
> **Reasonable Requests** - _think critically about the tenability of your ask_.
> This busy SME has put out content and now you are asking them to do more work!
> Are you trying to leverage their altruism to profit from content that they
> provided freely? Enough said.
> 
> **Contribute Back** - _the best way to learn is to do_.
> Contribute back to the community, by providing respectful, useful feedback and
> errata. This is one of my motivations for sharing content, the peer review
> results in an improved product for my students. We all start somewhere.


## 2022-02-18

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Leo
- Santi
- Mariana

**Discussion points:**

* Pair programming ensaio PR for changing versioning of datasets: https://github.com/fatiando/ensaio/pull/18
* After the PR is merged Leo will cut new release of Ensaio

## 2022-02-11

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

- Lu
- Mariana
- Leo
- Santi

**Discussion points:**

- Replaced Google Analytics with Plausible throughout the project
    - Now we have a more privacy-friendly analytics service.
    - You can see the stats here: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    - We also have plausible on the legacy website: https://plausible.io/legacy.fatiando.org
- The embedded Youtube videos in our website also have trackers, so we decided to remove it with thumbnails (plus some CSS hacks to make it look like YT interface): https://www.fatiando.org/learn/
- Leo has raised the idea to SWUNG of using Plausible for all the projects.
    - The board is looking at it very positively :tada:
- Pooch got a new release: 1.6.0! :rocket: :clinking_glasses: 
- Installation instructions for the old `fatiando` package: https://www.fatiando.org/install/#Installing-the-legacy-fatiando-package
    - No numpy v1.10 for windows, only >= 1.14 is available in conda-forge
    - Numpy 1.9 is available: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy/files?version=1.9.3
    - If you want to try it out, try it with `mamba` instead of `conda` (it's much faster): https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    - Maybe not worth the effort really. 
    - Could just tell people to copy the bit of the code that they need and see if it works in Python 3.
    - Follow up on Slack to see what they want out of Fatiando. If it doesn't involve compiled code, it may be easier to copy the source files.
- Santi wants to work on a `TesseroidLayer` after the PhD defense is done
- Also transform the gallery examples into actual tutorials for Harmonica
- Prioritize the FFT stuff that Lu started developing
- Add forward modelling of tensor components
- IDEA: pair programming hours!
    - Boosts productivity
    - Good learning experience
    - Might be good to try this out before Transform (last week of April)

## 2022-01-21

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

* Leo

* Migration of datasets to https://github.com/fatiando-data is complete!
    * Now need to update Ensaio to match
* Pooch 1.6.0: https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/283
    * Will make a new release as soon as I get some time
    * Drop Python 3.6 after this release
* Migrating analytics to Plausible:
    * Website, Harmonica, and legacy docs all converted
    * Santi wrote a script: https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/46
    * Any help running this in other repositories is appreciated

## 2022-01-14

**Time:** 14:00 (UTC)

**Participants** 

* Leo
* Santi

**Discussion points:**

* Happy new year! :confetti_ball: :fireworks: 
* Move the meeting to Gather Town
* Restructure how we forward some URLs (thanks Lu for catching the slack link error): https://github.com/fatiando/website/pull/46
    * Contact links need to be updated in some projects still
    * See https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/43
    * **Good novice issue** to tackle
* Trying out Plausible analytics on our main website
    * The statistics are public and anonymous for anyone who wishes to see them: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    * Trial for 30 days starting 22 Dec 2021
    * Leo will pay for now (we only need the cheapest tier)
    * **Shall we keep this?**
        * Decision: Keep Plausible! 
    * We can petition Software Underground to take up costs. It's easy to transfer our account to them and they can add us as admins. Could be used by other projects and the Swung websites as well.
        * Leo will write on the Slack explaining what we did and asking their opinion
    * If we like it, we can switch all our docs to this:
        * Update the code in the `doc` source template for all repositories
        * Make a script/macro to replace the google analytics code in the rendered HTML in all `gh-pages` branches (so we can monitor visits to older pages)
        * Have to replace [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L43) with [this code](https://github.com/fatiando/website/blob/6bf54d6172ecebc33f28ee2da681dc80ab36b28d/_templates/layout.html#L56)
        * **Anyone interested in giving this a try?**
    * Download and backup the data form Google Analytics. Maybe in the `community` repo. Could be a yearly thing.
        * Need to clean the country names. Take a look at the code that Santi wrote for his thesis (https://github.com/santisoler/phd-thesis/tree/main/analytics)
        * Make maybe a nice dashboard for this to display the data.
* Ensaio got a first release :tada: https://www.fatiando.org/ensaio/v0.1.0
    * Test it out with another package. Doesn't have to be a complete switch, just 1 example at a time. Verde or Harmonica are good candidates because they have more examples.
    * **Any takers?**
    * After discussion, the `ensaio.v1` imports are kind of strange and would require duplication of a lot of information once a new data major release is done. A better approach would be to package and release each dataset individually:
        * Ditch `v*` modules
        * Each `fetch_*` function will have a required `version` argument (can't be optional to avoid new releases breaking old docs)
        * Available versions should be listed in the docstrings.
        * Add a `source` (?) argument to choose whether to download the data from `"doi"` or `"github"`. Default to `"doi"`.
        * Use an env variable to change source of download, maybe `ENSAIO_DOWNLOAD_GITHUB` or something. This takes precedence over the `source` argument.
        * Each dataset needs to be moved to a different reporitory with an associated GitHub release and Zenodo DOI.
            * Should this be `data-*` repos on github.com/fatiando or do we make a new org just for that (github.com/fatiando-data)?
