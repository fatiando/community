# Organization accounts

This is a list of our organization accounts on social media, email, 
and such services. It also lists who currently holds the passwords
and responsibility for each.

Holders and administrators of these accounts are expected to:

* Use a atrong password, only used in a single place, and randomly generated. 
* Enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) if available on the account.
* Use a password manager to store account credentials safely (i.e., don't store passwords in text files or emails to yourself).

This also applies to personal accounts when a user is made an admin on a Fatiando account.
