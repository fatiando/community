--------------------------------------------------------------

## 2024-12-10

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Matt
* Arthur

**Notes**

* Issue that Matt opened Verde:
    * https://github.com/fatiando/verde/issues/474
    * Would be nice to include such class
    * No need to add optuna as dependency, the class doesn't need it.
    * For testing we could either use optuna to define a Trial (to test the __call__ method), or mock our own Trial class that returns a single value of damping.
    * Would be nice to allow users to pass the gridder they want to use, instead of hard coding the Spline in the call method.
* EquivalentSourcesCV:
    * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/543
    * Would be nice to have this as well!
    * Santi doesn't quite like having to code a new CV class for every gridder (even in Verde), but generalizing CVs for eqs seems hard (due to the different interfaces that Eqs classes have). So let's start simple with EquivalentSourcesCV.
* Security breach in ultralytics (not affecting any Fatiando package)
    * PR that reported the security issue: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/18027
    * Nice blogpost explaining what happened: https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/12/06/zizmor-ultralytics-injection
    * We might want to audit our GitHub Actions
    * We should use [zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) to check the integrity of our Actions (now and in the future)
    * We should also consider linting the bash scripts we wrote in our Actions with something like `shellcheck`. It can also catch unsanitized inputs like unquoted variables.
    * Would be also nice to open a discussion in Scientific Python promoting the usage of zizmor and shellcheck on Actions.
* Equivalent sources, depth_ attribute. We could extend the description to specify what happens when we pass a float to the depth argument.
    * https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica/latest/api/generated/harmonica.EquivalentSources.html#harmonica.EquivalentSources
* Set next meeting for Jan 7, since we have holidays in two weeks

## 2024-11-26

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Leo
* Matt
* Gelson
* Santi

**Notes**

* Matt is doing a postdoc in New York in [Lamont-Doherty Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu/)

### Pooch

* We have a few PRs that add support for other sources:
    * NIST data base (doi-based)
    * Network shared file systems
        * Seems ok as long as there's a test. It's basically just file copying with our cache system added.
* Broad decisions on supporting new sources?
    * minimum requirement: documented API
    * Would be nice to move these doi downloaders to plugin libraries.
    * Need to open an issue to discuss the plug in part.
* Ditch pylint, maybe replace it with ruff. The lazy solution is copying flake8 config from our other projects.
    * Nice documentation from scientific-python: https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/style/

### Harmonica

* Reader for gxf files
    * Should it always return an xarray?
    * Do we need more than one public function for them?
    * Single function that returns an dataarray should be ok.
    * Use x and y for rotated grids, but easting and northing for non-rotated ones.
* Using Harmonica in class at USP:
    * Some annoying bits while computing the derivatives.
        * Having to add and subtract padding. https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/390
            * Would be nice to include padding in the functions.
            * By default would be nice to use linear ramp to the mean value of the grid.
        * Having to remove the vertical coordinates (or any non-dimensional coordinates), and then add them back.
            * It would make sense if the functions take non-dimensional coordinates out and restore them back before returning the inverted-FFT grid.
            
### Verde

* Status of filling NaNs in grids: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/440
    * Basically halted waiting for someone to pick it up
    
### Choclo v0.3.1 release:

* Make 2nd order and 3rd order kernels to return nan
    * This is the proper behaviour, returning zero is not right. So a patch release is ok.
* Make docstrings smaller by collapsing similar arguments into the same line (easting, northing, upward).

### Improve docstrings

* Move some implementation details and theory to the Notes section. Keep descriptions to only a single line and then list the parameters.
    * Example: https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica/latest/api/generated/harmonica.EulerDeconvolution.html
    
### Calls

* Calls have been low traffic and the earlier time slot doesnt seem to work for most people. How about we keep only this one and do these every 2 weeks instead of weekly?
    * Ask what people think in the chat?

## 2024-10-29

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Gelson
* Leo
* India

**Notes**

* Boule v0.5.0 has been released!
    * Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/boule/latest/changes.html#version-0-5-0
    * Conda-forge build apparently was skipped for some reason
    * Triggered a new one: https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/feedstock-builds/_build/results?buildId=1066717&view=logs&s=6884a131-87da-5381-61f3-d7acc3b91d76
    * Fixed now! 
* Choclo v0.3.0 has been released!
    * Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/changes.html#version-0-3-0
* We have Plausible analytics back again: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org
    * Apparently we have a gap now: https://plausible.io/fatiando.org?period=year&keybindHint=Y
* Gravity processing code for shipborne data: https://github.com/PFPE/shipgrav
* Yago is adding QDM data: https://github.com/fatiando-data/qdm-magnetic-microscopy
    * Suggest separating into raw data and netCDF format (for use in Harmonica)
* Magnetic eq sources (India and Santi)
    * Some thoughts on the fit method of the class
    * tfa needs inclination and declination
    * The interface looks a bit clumsy: having to pass tuples with arrays in the right order.
    * Do we have a use for combined fitting of tfa and magnetic components?
        * Not for now, but we could have use cases for fitting multiple components
    * Let's write the class to fit TFA only for now.
        * The fit method then could take coordinates, data, inclination, declination, weights=None.
* Leo tried implementing reduction to the pole in class:
    * Harmonica equations: https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica/latest/api/generated/harmonica.filters.reduction_to_pole_kernel.html#harmonica.filters.reduction_to_pole_kernel
        * The Harmonica implementation is ok
        * Maybe we want to reuse the angle to vector functions we have instead of reimplementing those in the filter.
        * The docs could be improved:
            * The `sin I` gives the downward component of the magnetization vector, not the upward one.


## 2024-10-08

**Time:** 14:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Mariana
* Gelson

**Notes**

* Mariana was required to make a JupyterBook in her current job, and her experience with the fatiando tutorials helped her a lot!
    * The job: analyzing data of how the water permits are distributed across the country between companies and how those change in different locations.
    * The position is at Universidad Iberoamericana.
* Choclo updates:
    * Implemented magnetic gradiometry forward functions and kernels for prisms in Choclo
        * Spatial derivatives of magnetic field components due to rectangular prisms
        * PR: https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/97 
    * Found a bug in the second-order kernels (the ones for the magnetic components): https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/issues/98
        * Hard to track bug! Due to machine precision
        * Already fixed: https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/100
    * I'm planning to make a Choclo release soon!
* We merged a few PRs in Boule and Mark suggested us to make a release soon so he can use the latest changes in SHTOOLS.

## 2024-10-01

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Gelson
* Leo
* India

**Notes**

* Santi's draft PR for magnetic gradiometry kernels in Choclo: https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/97
    * Implementation of the kernels and forward functions are done.
    * Working on more tests (specially on singular points of the kernels).
* India started working on magnetic equivalent sources!
    * Should we able able to fit the norm of B?
        * It would be nice to have if it's not too much work.
        * But we could add it later once the first draft is finished.
    * Stack the jacobian matrices if we want to use the least squares function in verde
    * We could sum the jacobians and the hessians instead (that's how we were doing it in the old fatiando). But this won't allow us to use the least squares function in verde.
    * The predict method should not return tfa (we have a function for it). Return the three components for now. If we want to have some `fields` argument, we could add it later.
* Leo used the Legendre functions in class and they worked great
    * Running (2D) spherical harmonics on GPU: https://github.com/NVIDIA/torch-harmonics
* Inverse problems solvers in SimPEG and Fatiando
    * PyLOPS: https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    * scipy LinearOperator: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator.html

## 2024-09-24

**Time:** 14:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Gelson
* India

**Notes**

* Santi started working on forward functions and kernels for magnetic gradiometry components due to prisms (in Choclo).
    * These forward functions would compute the spatial derivatives of the magnetic field components due to rectangular prisms

* Takahashi's repository for fast equivalent sources using Toeplitz matrices: https://github.com/pinga-lab/eq_layer_mag_toeplitz/

## 2024-09-17

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Gelson
* Santi

**Notes**

* Idea to implement equivalent sources in grid that can predict on a co-registered grid of observation points
    * We can take advantage of the symmetry of the sources and observation points locations:
        * This would allow us to speed up the computations and significantly reduce the memory needed to fit the sources' coefficients.
    * Possible applications: 
        * Process magnetic microscopy data.
        * Alternatives to the FFT processing methods on grids (RTP, etc) with comparable computation times and memory requirements.
    * We can apply Takahashi's method (doi: [10.1190/geo2019-0826.1](https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2019-0826.1):
        * The jacobian matrices are [Toeplitz matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix) (elements in the diagonals are all equal), so we can avoid building the whole matrix (only first row and firt column are enough).
        * The matrix vector dot product can be computed using FFTs.
    * Considerations:
        * The data used to fit the sources should be in a regular grid
        * The sources should be in a regular grid (co-registered with the observation points) at constant depth.
        * Once the sources are fit, we can used them to predict on the same observation points (we can reuse the Toeplitz jacobian matrix), or on any observation point (through direct forwards, which might take time, but don't require huge memory).
    * Disadvantages:
        * This only works if the data is already in a regular grid. This is not a replacement of the gradient-boosted equivalent sources.
    * Other relevant papers:
        * [10.1093/gji/ggv301](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggv301)
        * [10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.01.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2018.01.002)
    * Design ideas:
        * The new class should not be a child of the equivalent sources one we already have 
        * The only parameters the class should take are `depth`, `damping`, `inclination` and `declination` of the sources (no `points`!)
            * All sources will have the same inclination and declination
            * The coefficients theclass will fit are going to be the magnitude of the magnetic moment
                * do we need to use a positivity constrain here? Or shall we allow the moments to be in opposite direction?
        * The depth of the sources will be constant, so `depth` will be a float
        * The `fit` method should take an `xarray.DataArray` with the easting and northing coordinates and the data we want to fit in a grid.
            * We'll have to sort out how to specify which fields they can predict (the whole B, the bz only, the tfa, etc)
            * For now, we can aim to fit the bz field
        * For the `predict` method:
            * Simple: make a direct forward
            * Optionally: we can store the jacobian matrix (it's only two vectors), but we would need to make sure that the data grid is the same as the one where we want to predict.

**Time:** 14:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Gelson

**Notes:**

* Plans for bringing Moulder to Python3
    * Checking if the polygon is clockwise https://github.com/santisoler/fatiando/blob/be2bc3001849279f8e8ccbb67d934f6b684220a9/fatiando/mesher/geometry.py#L93-L213
    * Implement the code directly in Harmonica the same as it is in the old Fatiando
    * We can then start a kernel in Choclo and swap out the numpy code once it's done
    * Moulder didn't have a license (too bad!). Now it has: https://github.com/fatiando/moulder/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
* Pooch talk at SciPy2024
    * We should add the video to the docs

## 2024-08-27

**Time:** 14:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi

**Notes:**

* Noticed that the package `build` available in conda-forge is outdated, `python-build` should be used instead.
    * The latest version of `build` is not compatible with Python 3.12 and is causing problems while trying to create environments.

* Leo

**Notes:**

* Santi at SciPy2024 :snake: :snow_capped_mountain: :bird:
    * Awesome conference! Totally recommended!
    * Scientific Python: https://www.scientific-python.org
        * Developer guide: https://learn.scientific-python.org/development
            * Recommending using `hatchery` as the build engine (instead of `setuptools`)
        * SPECs: https://scientific-python.org/specs/
            * Like PEPs and NEPs, but for the whole scientific community
            * Still under construction/discussion. Join the conversation: https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/specs/6
        * There are discussions on including tips to enhance the security of scientific packages. Santi proposed to create a thread model and then list tasks that would mitigate those risks: from direct attack by state/independent actors to bus factor (only one person having access to the credentials for services like PyPI or ownership of the GitHub community, etc.)
    * [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) included rules to warn ppl about Numpy deprecated features that were removed in Numpy 2.0
        * These rules were created in collaboration between Ruff devs and Numpy community
        * A reason to consider moving away from `flake8` into `ruff`
    * [`ipython` sphinx directive](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sphinxext.html) being under development
        * Might be an alternative to the `jupyter-execute` one
    * Numba devs are working on PIXIE: a package to compile numba code ahead of time.
        * Still in beta
        * https://numba-pixie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    * Xarray will have a new class: `DataTree`
        * Allows to fully support the netCDF standard: nested datasets.
        * Original experimental repo: https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree
        * Current implementation in `xarray` repo: https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/main/xarray/core/datatree.py
        * Still under development
        * Coordinate inheritance: https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/9077
        * Santi worked on it during the sprints
    * Curious things:
        * Using `mpi4py` to create non-shared-memory parallelizations. Parallelizing Numba code (with `parallel=False`) across cluster nodes.
        * Idea to optimize our Numba codes. We can loop over threads in parallel instead of over the whole range of number of observation points. That way, we can assign "chunks" of the observation points to each thread, so they can read and write arrays sequentially, which might speed up the computations.
* Gelson is implementig magnetic forward modelling of tetrahedrons. Coming soon to Choclo :slightly_smiling_face:

**Notes:**

* Harmonica v0.7:
    * Maybe we can get this in as well: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/493
* Numpy 2.0.0 is out there!
    * Rerunning some tests on CI to see if there are any issues with our packages
    * Harmonica works fine! Some doctests are failing because Numpy>=2.0.0 prints `np.float64(3.0)` instead of `3.0` (to avoid confusion with Python floats).
    * Choclo and numba work great!
    * Verde tests are broken because of a badly formatted exception: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/actions/runs/9555832761/job/26339861103
* Harmonica:
    * After dropped Python 3.9, we don't need the thing with macos x86
* src vs flat layout

    * We could start implementing a src layout in Pooch and see how it goes

## 2024-06-11

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* India
* Jose Maria

**Notes:**

* Shall we release Verde v1.8.1 (https://github.com/fatiando/verde/issues/446)?
    * Verde 1.8.0 doesn't work in Python 3.12 because of the `pkg_resources` that Leo already fixed in https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/448
    * This blocks extending support for Python 3.12 on all packages that depend on Verde (Harmonica for example: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/484/)
* pypozo: https://github.com/JoseMariaGarciaMarquez/pypozo
* Conversations about moving tests outside the package folders: https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/154
* Roadmap for Harmonica v0.7.0:
    * We would like to have the total field anomaly function
    * Support for Py 3.12
    * Change default value for depth in eqs

## 2024-06-04

**Time:** 14:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Leo
* India
* Lu
* Yago
* Gelson
* Arthur

**Notes:**

* India finish the default window size PR!
* Idea: the whole CI and development workflow is hard to document and hard to get started. Maybe it would be worth running a yearly development bootcamp where we train people on this. Could work in break out rooms individually. 2h would be enough: 1h for intro and 1h to work on things in breakout rooms. Topics: github workflow, running checks, CI, tests, building docs, etc.
* Idea from TRANSFORM:
    * People like video tutorials
    * Do a joint tutorial with SimPEG
    * Use Harmonica et al to process gravity or mag data
    * Hand the grid to simpeg for a simple inversion
    * Gelson: shared a tutorial that had very short (a few mins) videos for each section of the notebook. That makes it easy to update the videos. Example notebook: https://github.com/FORCaist/forcsensei/blob/master/FORCsensei.ipynb
    * This format would be great with the tutorials that Mariana is working on.
    * So format doesn't really fit Transform but it's better in the long term
    * Think about what we'd want from an offline event

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Mariana
* Leo

**Quick updates:**

* Next meeting we'll have Lu's talk about his adventures in Antarctica :penguin:!
    * We should promote it on Mattermost, social media, etc
    * Live streaming? Or just record it and then upload?
    * Ask Lu if we can live stream it
    * We can live stream it directly from Jitsi
        * Make a practice run before the talk
        * Need Youtube API and **start the stream** on Youtube!
    * We can schedule the live stream ahead of time. This way we can share the link in social media, add it to the calendar, etc
* Santi's maintenance works:
    * Replace Sphinx napoleon for numpydoc in multiple libraries: https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/149
        * These changes would improve how we show the API docs of classes (solving issues with attributes that have a trailing underscode, like `coefs_`).
        * Check if we can also list methods as a toc on the right menu.
    * Solved issues with tests failing in MacOS runners using the oldest dependencies: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/499
        * New macos GitHub runners make use of Apple silicon (M1, M2 chips). Numpy for Python 3.8 is not available for those chips.
        * Solved the issue by running the Python 3.8 tests on the latest x86 (intel chips) macos runners.
    * Codecov failing when trying to upload multiple files (specially when PR is opened from a fork)
        * Working on solving it by uploading coverage reports as artifacts and uploading them all on a single run
        * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/502
* Leo's nerdy week:
    * Associated Legendre functions! Did a deep dive and started implementing (almost finished, just speeding them up now) https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/505
    * IGRF in Harmonica: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/504
    * It's fine to add Boule as a dependency
```python
class IGRF(date, ellipsoid=boule.WGS84):
    ...

IGRF(datetime(1990, 3, 14)).predict((lon, lat, height), field="b")
IGRF(datetime(1990, 3, 14)).grid(grid_coords, field="b")

sh = MagneticSphericalHarmonics(g, h, ref_radius=..., normalization="schmidt", ellipsoid=None)
sh.predict(..., field="b")
sh.grid(..., field="b")

sh = MagneticSphericalHarmonics(max_degree, ref_radius=..., normalization="schmidt", ellipsoid=None)
sh.fit(
    be=((lon, lat, height), be), 
    bn=((lon, lat, height), bn), 
    bu=((lon, lat, height), bu), 
)

sh = GravitySphericalHarmonics(max_degree, ref_radius=..., normalization="full", ellipsoid=None)
sh.fit(
    gz=((lon, lat, height), gz), 
    gxx=((lon, lat, height), gxx), 
)
sh.predict((lon, lat, height), field="gz")
```

**Participants:**

* India
* Santi

**Quick updates:**

* Harmonica CI's failing on MacOS with Python 3.8
    * Not being able to install Numpy with pip
    * Trying to fix it: [#496](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/496)
* Pair programming on India's PR for changing default `window_size` in gradient-boosted eqs:
    * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/487
    * If the passed `coordinates` have less than 5e3 points, then a warning is raised and a single window will be used.
    * The `self.window_size_` is set to None in that case, since it's not being used for defining the window.
    * Few ideas to improve this: use `slice` instead of `np.arange` in the intermediate returns.

**Quick updates:**

- Codedov push failing in https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/486
    - Reran the test to see if it pass nows
- :rocket::tada: Choclo v0.2.0 has been released! :tada::rocket:
    - Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/changes.html#version-0-2-0
    - Highlights:
        - Improved docs with dark theme :sunglasses:
        - Restored kernel functions for point sources (needed for micropaleomag applications)
- Roadmap to Harmonica v0.7.0:
    - Milestones: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/milestone/8
    - What about Python 3.12 support? Blocked by issue with `pkg_resources` in Verde. (see https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/484)
        - Fixed in Verde! https://github.com/fatiando/verde/pull/448 Will be available in v1.8.1 coming soon.
    - I think we can make a release after finishing [#487](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/487) and tackling [#424](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/424) (Santi can work on that one)
- Martin
    - Progress on the xml reader grd files
    - Able to read the `wellknown_epsg` attribute on the `projection` tag
    - Add a private function to read the xml file
    - We talked about the signature of that function: it's better if it returns a dictionary witht the "EPSG" value inside. Then the `attrs` dictionary can be extended before passing it to the xarray object. 
        - This would allow us to extend the reader of xml without having to change other code.
- Chat on [#487](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/487)
    - We need to add tests checking if the window size is set properly
    - Maybe defining a grid with N times 5_000 points and comparing the value of window size it gets assigned against the expected one. We should use `numpy.testing.assert_allclose()` for that since we are comparing floats.
- Plan for Lu's talk on one of the 14:00 GMT meetings! :penguin:

    * Go back to the two times (one every two weeks)
    * 14:00 GMT sounds like the best option
* Discussions around arguments for equivalent sources:
    * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/425

* Done some maintenance work on Choclo and Harmonica
* I think Leo Miquellutti's PR on total gradient amplitude might be ready to be merged: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/478 :tada:
* Lu came back from Antarctica! :penguin: 
    * Ice drilling and sampling every 5 cm (on 200m hole!)
    * Grav, mag, MT surveys
    * He's willing to give a presentation about his work there
* We should have another meeting time that's more suitable for Lu

* Discussion around some Harmonica issues regarding equivalent sources
    * Better default for the `depth`: we could make it clever enought to set the depth argument as 4.5 times the average distance between the data points. Shall we still allow users to set the `depth` manually? Should we include a `depth_factor` argument that defaults to 4.5? Should `depth=None` by default and in that case the class should compute it with that formula?
    * Better default for window size: set it allowing to have in average 5k data points per window. Maybe we should include the `5_000` as an argument of the class instead of hard coding it.

* Agustina

**Quick announcements**

* :mega: We are changing time of the meetings to every **Tuesday 17:00 GMT** 

**Agenda**

:rotating_light: **Group programming** :rotating_light: 

- The goal is to tackle one of the Harmonica Issues ([#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423) was chosen last week) in group so we can all learn from the process and the train of thought involved in contributing to Fatiando.
- One could take the lead and type, while the rest chime in with ideas and questions.
- The idea is not to make it a _live stream_ where the protagonist is the typer, but to make it as interactive as possible. Other people can take the lead and start typing themselves.
- Ultimate goals:
    - Allow new contributors to get more familiar with the process
    - Learn about best practices for software development
    - Learn about why we make certain decisions (backward compatibility, raise warnings on breaking changes, adding tests and documentation, etc)
    - Encourage new contributors to open their own PRs
    
**What we did**

- Started working on solving [#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423)
- Opened a PR: [468](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/468)
- We still need to apply changes to gradient boosted equivalent sources

    ```
    * Santi: these warnings are comming from Pandas (Mariana was using `pandas==2.2.1` here). We should check if these are reproduced in Verde and fix them upstream. In summary: it's great the tutorials are raising these warnings, but we should not tackle them in the tutorials repo.

    * For this warning: 
        ```
        NumbaWarning: The TBB threading layer requires TBB version 2021 update 6 or later i.e., TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION >= 12060. Found TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION = 12050. The TBB threading layer is disabled.
      warnings.warn(problem)
        ```
        * Possible solution? https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/7531#issuecomment-1793233020
        * Santi: With the latest version of `tbb` it should be fine. Although I'm curious why conda installed an old version of it...
        * Mariana pushed the new environment to a new branch so we reproduce this: https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/tree/update_environment

* Changing meeting times:
    * Currently the only ones that can make it to the meeting of 00:00 GMT are the ones in PT (Pacific Time). Until Lu returns to his routine, we could move it to a time that's better for everyone else.
    * Leo cannot attend to the Thursdays 17:00 GMT meetings from now until August. We could move these meetings to same time on Mon, Tue, or Fri.
    * Santi prefers Tue or Fri. One Tue per month it will clash with Swung meeting.
    * TODO:
        * [x] Move all meetings to 17:00 GMT
        * [x] Decide which day might be better for everyone: **Tuesday**
        * [x] Update Google calendar
        * [x] Write a message in Mattermost letting people know. Let ppl know we are planning to do _group_ programming
        * [x] Post in the forum
        * [x] Check if we need to update the time in `fatiando/community`
* Harmonica issues to tackle in the near future:
    * We can go and change the default value of `window_size` directly without going through the warning-release process: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/425
    * For [#424](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/424) we would make one PR for raising the warnings, and then another one for actually making the change (that will be merged for 0.8)
* Ideas for future meetings:
    * Do some pair programming or demos/intros on how to code and contribute
    * We can start with [#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423) next week!

**Participants:**
* Mariana
* Leo
* India

**Quick updates:**
* Mariana: Working in issue https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/issues/12
    * Verde env has the latest compatible versions of most things: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/blob/main/environment.yml - Generates these pages: https://www.fatiando.org/verde/dev/
* Mariana: Is this image correct? https://www.fatiando.org/tutorials/_images/topographic-correction.svg
* India and Marian's meet up in the UK
* Leo did some work on Verde
* Leo tried and failed to get the Spline fit working with a conjugate-gradient method using Scipy's `LinearOperator`. For some reason, the method doesn't want to converge with the type of matrix we have in the Spline. Tested it on a simple matrix that looks like our and it just doesn't converge (but it does for a random matrix).

    * We need more hands in the project.
    * Leo will email and CC council to invite.
* Add `MAINTAINERS.md` file to repos listing maintainers
    * That file should live in the repo for each package
    * Leo will update the GitHub teams
* India shared and idea for generating regular grids at angles, useful for "diagonal" flight lines
    * It would be nice to see an issue with more details about it
    * One possible implementation would be to generate the grid and then rotate the coordinate system

* Leo

**Quick updates:**

* Santi went to AGU
    * Met Matt Tankersely in person! Matt had a poster, and a lightning talk in the same session as me. Was great to talk about Fatiando and also see his presentation mentioning the same tools.
    * Met Blazej Bucha. He contributed to Boule. Great work on spherical harmonics: https://github.com/blazej-bucha.
    * Lunch with Fernando Perez, Jim (2i2c) and Rowan and Steve (Curvenote)
    * Geolatinas gatherings!
    * Met Yago and Suzana (Yago will start as Master Student with Leo)
    * Met Carlos Alberto Moreno Chaves, from USP.
    * Ines Sanchez Rodriguez, Hydrology. opencollaborationhydrology.com. Got invited to participate in a podcast about open-source. It'll probably be in Spanish.
    * HÃ©lÃ¨ne Le MÃ©vel. Awesome inversions of gravity satelite data before, during and after the eruption of Hunga Tonga.
        * Paper is out: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3156
    * Tasha Snow. CryoCloud: https://www.cryocloud.io/. Great talk about why open science!
        * Intelectual generosity
        * Intelectual humility
        * Right to participate in science (democratizing it)
        * Everyone deserves dignity and respect
        * Open Science is a process, not a product!
    * Project Pythia.
    * Center of Open Science: https://www.cos.io/
    * Folks from NumFOCUS were there: Xarray, Dask, etc. Ryan Abernathey, Deepak Cherian.
    * Nigel Rees. Haven't got the chance to meet him, but he emailed me about the Fatiando poster. Matt had a talk with him.
    * Jiajia Sun. Interested in having magnetic equivalent sources in Harmonica.
    * I gave away a lot of Fatiando stickers. Even in the plane: the student that was sitting next to me knew about it :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
        * Sarai MontaÃ±ez MuÃ±oz
* Faster terrain correction by block averaging.
    * Santi discussed some implementation with Craig before Banff.
    * We kept talking about it with Matt.
    * After AGU I started drafting an implementation: https://github.com/santisoler/harmonica/blob/prism-layer-fast-forward/harmonica/_forward/prism_layer.py
* Plan to start adding kernels in Choclo for magnetic gradiometry
* Discussion on Harmonica Issues for better defaults for equivalent sources:
    * Santi will tackle the removal of the `depth_type`
    * India will tackle the better defaults for `window_size` and `depth`
* Leo: Started playing with spherical harmonics. SHTools is a bit large and overkill when we just want simple synthesis of a low degree model (like a lot of magnetic models). Plus, there is no package I found that can do the inversion part for scattered data (SHTools only does it for grids). I'll need this for class and for some projects so will start coding something and maybe get a student involved. **Should this be part of Harmonica or its own package?** The surface harmonics can be used for other things and the associated Legendre function calculation as well (scipy has it but it wraps an ugly fortran code and the normalization isn't very clear). But otherwise, this fits with the equivalent source stuff in Harmonica.
    * It could live in Harmonica!
* Improving tests for Pooch downloaders:
    * Right now Pooch's tests rely on third-party servers being available when testing
    * If those servers go down, Pooch tests start failing
    * Idea: mock httpservers with `pytest-httpserver` for testing purposes.
    * Keep the current tests, but maybe make them optional
    * We should **open an issue** for creating an sftp server using pytest just to test it
* Design choices for forwards and physical equivalent sources:
    * Merge magnetic forward functions in Harmonica to a single one, that either returns a single array, or a tuple of arrays
        * Those should take a `field` argument that could be `b_e`, `b_n`, `b_u` or `b` for the full vector, required argument.
    * Constructing the equivalent sources takes regular parameters plus the inc,dec of the sources
    * Fitting would be nice as ``
    * Design draft for the `fit` and `predict` methods for the eq mag sources
        ```
        class EquivalentMagSources:
            def __init__(self, ...):
                ...
                
            def fit(self, tfa=None, b_ee=None, ...):
                ...

            def predict(self, coordinates, field):
                ...
            
        eqs = hm.EquivalentMagSources(
            depth=..., 
            inc_sources: float =..., 
            dec_sources: float =...,
        )
        eqs.fit(
            tfa=(coordinates, data, weights, inclination, declination),
            b_ee=(coordinates, data, weights),
            b_nn=(coordinates, data, weights),
        )
        b_ee = eqs.predict(coordiantes, data, field="b_ee")
        (b_e, b_n, b_u) = eqs.predict(coordiantes, data, field="b")
        tfa = hm.total_field_anomaly((b_e, b_n, b_u), inc, dec)
        ```
        
* We might want to check if `hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec` work well with inc and dec as floats and amplitude as array.
    * Write tests!
* The mag forward modelling functions take magnetizations as 2d array with each magnetic moment per row. We should change this to accept a tuple with the three components:
    ```
    dipole_magnetic(
        coordinates,
        dipoles,
        magnetic_moments=(magnetization_e, magnetization_n, magnetization_u),
        parallel=True,
        dtype="float64",
        disable_checks=False,
    ): 
    ```
    * This makes it consistent with `hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec` and with how coordinates are handled.
    
* Leo: Trying to find a good magnetic microscopy dataset to add to Ensaio. Will clean up the one we used [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5QD5Z) because it's relatively good with a bunch of well behaved dipoles. Great for running grid-related examples in Harmonica since the data is on a regular grid at constant height from the very start. Would also be good for an Euler Deconvolution example since they're all very close to dipoles.
