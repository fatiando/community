## 2024-04-16

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* Leo Miquelutti
* Mariana
* India
* Martin

**Quick updates:**

- Codedov push failing in https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/486
    - Reran the test to see if it pass nows
- :rocket::tada: Choclo v0.2.0 has been released! :tada::rocket:
    - Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/changes.html#version-0-2-0
    - Highlights:
        - Improved docs with dark theme :sunglasses:
        - Restored kernel functions for point sources (needed for micropaleomag applications)
- Roadmap to Harmonica v0.7.0:
    - Milestones: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/milestone/8
    - What about Python 3.12 support? Blocked by issue with `pkg_resources` in Verde. (see https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/484)
    - I think we can make a release after finishing [#487](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/487) and tackling [#424](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/424) (Santi can work on that one)
- Martin
    - Progress on the xml reader grd files
    - Able to read the `wellknown_epsg` attribute on the `projection` tag
    - Add a private function to read the xml file
    - We talked about the signature of that function: it's better if it returns a dictionary witht the "EPSG" value inside. Then the `attrs` dictionary can be extended before passing it to the xarray object. 
        - This would allow us to extend the reader of xml without having to change other code.
- Chat on [#487](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/487)
    - We need to add tests checking if the window size is set properly
    - Maybe defining a grid with N times 5_000 points and comparing the value of window size it gets assigned against the expected one. We should use `numpy.testing.assert_allclose()` for that since we are comparing floats.
- Plan for Lu's talk on one of the 14:00 GMT meetings! :penguin:

## 2024-04-02

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* India
* Mariana
* Leo
* Martin

**Quick updates:**

* Update meeting times
    * Go back to the two times (one every two weeks)
    * 14:00 GMT sounds like the best option
* Discussions around arguments for equivalent sources:
    * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/425
    * https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/424
    * Use `"default"` as default value instead of `None`
- India's workflow:
    - JupyterHub (because here she has configured ssh key with Github) &rarr;  terminal &rarr; `git clone repo` &rarr; `mamba create env` &rarr; `conda activate harmonica` &rarr; `git grep EquivalentSourcesGB` (to search for which file needs to change) &rarr; edit file gradient_boosted.py &rarr; 
    - To get a nice bash prompt with little effort: https://starship.rs/
- Mariana's idea: use breakout rooms for tackling multiple issues at the same time
    
**Todo:**

- [x] Update meeting times:
    - [x] Update fatiando calendar (santi)
    - [x] Post on Mattermost (santi)
    - [x] Post on forum (mariana)
    - [x] Post on linkedin (mariana)

## 2024-03-26

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Mariana
* India
* Lu
* Santi

**Quick updates:**

* Question regarding Zenodo citations: [fatiando/community@145](https://github.com/fatiando/community/issues/145)
* Done some maintenance work on Choclo and Harmonica
* I think Leo Miquellutti's PR on total gradient amplitude might be ready to be merged: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/478 :tada:
* Lu came back from Antarctica! :penguin: 
    * Ice drilling and sampling every 5 cm (on 200m hole!)
    * Grav, mag, MT surveys
    * He's willing to give a presentation about his work there
* We should have another meeting time that's more suitable for Lu
    * [timeanddate meeting planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20240402&p1=256&p2=136&p3=196&p4=233&p5=247)
* Discussion around some Harmonica issues regarding equivalent sources
    * Better default for the `depth`: we could make it clever enought to set the depth argument as 4.5 times the average distance between the data points. Shall we still allow users to set the `depth` manually? Should we include a `depth_factor` argument that defaults to 4.5? Should `depth=None` by default and in that case the class should compute it with that formula?
    * Better default for window size: set it allowing to have in average 5k data points per window. Maybe we should include the `5_000` as an argument of the class instead of hard coding it.

## 2024-03-05

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Mariana
* India
* Gelson
* Santi
* Leo
* Agustina

**Quick announcements**

* :mega: We are changing time of the meetings to every **Tuesday 17:00 GMT** 

**Agenda**

:rotating_light: **Group programming** :rotating_light: 

- The goal is to tackle one of the Harmonica Issues ([#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423) was chosen last week) in group so we can all learn from the process and the train of thought involved in contributing to Fatiando.
- One could take the lead and type, while the rest chime in with ideas and questions.
- The idea is not to make it a _live stream_ where the protagonist is the typer, but to make it as interactive as possible. Other people can take the lead and start typing themselves.
- Ultimate goals:
    - Allow new contributors to get more familiar with the process
    - Learn about best practices for software development
    - Learn about why we make certain decisions (backward compatibility, raise warnings on breaking changes, adding tests and documentation, etc)
    - Encourage new contributors to open their own PRs
    
**What we did**

- Started working on solving [#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423)
- Opened a PR: [468](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/468)
- We still need to apply changes to gradient boosted equivalent sources

**Quick updates:**

* Mariana: Working in issue https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/issues/12
    * How can I get rid of this warning? It means something needs to be changed in Verde?

    ```
    * Santi: these warnings are comming from Pandas (Mariana was using `pandas==2.2.1` here). We should check if these are reproduced in Verde and fix them upstream. In summary: it's great the tutorials are raising these warnings, but we should not tackle them in the tutorials repo.

    * For this warning: 
        ```
        NumbaWarning: The TBB threading layer requires TBB version 2021 update 6 or later i.e., TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION >= 12060. Found TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION = 12050. The TBB threading layer is disabled.
      warnings.warn(problem)
        ```
        * Possible solution? https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/7531#issuecomment-1793233020
        * Santi: With the latest version of `tbb` it should be fine. Although I'm curious why conda installed an old version of it...
        * Mariana pushed the new environment to a new branch so we reproduce this: https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/tree/update_environment

* Changing meeting times:
    * Currently the only ones that can make it to the meeting of 00:00 GMT are the ones in PT (Pacific Time). Until Lu returns to his routine, we could move it to a time that's better for everyone else.
    * Leo cannot attend to the Thursdays 17:00 GMT meetings from now until August. We could move these meetings to same time on Mon, Tue, or Fri.
    * Santi prefers Tue or Fri. One Tue per month it will clash with Swung meeting.
    * TODO:
        * [x] Move all meetings to 17:00 GMT
        * [x] Decide which day might be better for everyone: **Tuesday**
        * [x] Update Google calendar
        * [x] Write a message in Mattermost letting people know. Let ppl know we are planning to do _group_ programming
        * [x] Post in the forum
        * [x] Check if we need to update the time in `fatiando/community`
* Harmonica issues to tackle in the near future:
    * We can go and change the default value of `window_size` directly without going through the warning-release process: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/425
    * For [#424](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/424) we would make one PR for raising the warnings, and then another one for actually making the change (that will be merged for 0.8)
* Ideas for future meetings:
    * Do some pair programming or demos/intros on how to code and contribute
    * We can start with [#423](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/423) next week!


## 2024-02-15

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**
* Mariana
* Leo
* India

**Quick updates:**
* Mariana: Working in issue https://github.com/fatiando/tutorials/issues/12
    * Verde env has the latest compatible versions of most things: https://github.com/fatiando/verde/blob/main/environment.yml - Generates these pages: https://www.fatiando.org/verde/dev/
* Mariana: Is this image correct? https://www.fatiando.org/tutorials/_images/topographic-correction.svg
* India and Marian's meet up in the UK
* Leo did some work on Verde
* Leo tried and failed to get the Spline fit working with a conjugate-gradient method using Scipy's `LinearOperator`. For some reason, the method doesn't want to converge with the type of matrix we have in the Spline. Tested it on a simple matrix that looks like our and it just doesn't converge (but it does for a random matrix).


## 2024-02-01

* Leo: Found a bug in the vertical derivative when implementing Euler deconvolution for a class: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/454 **Good issue for beginners**
* Leo: Trying to update versions of packages in Verde but running into a few issues. I think it's something on my computer with GMT and sphinx. I keep getting crashes that don't happen on CI. Will try changing OS and see if it keeps happening.
* India: Do one of the calls as a demo of porting a function or notebook code from a paper/research repo into a package. 

## 2024-01-26

**Time:** 00:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi :-(

**Quick updates:**

* Santi won't attend to the next few meetings. See you all back after Feb 15.
* Harmonica
    * I think we should really tackle a few last PRs before the end of Feb so we can make a new release of Harmonica.
    * Milestone for v0.7.0: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/milestone/8
        * I decided to move [#352](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/352) and [#353](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/353) to v0.8.0.
    * Leo, would be nice to have https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/441 as well. No pressure, but I think it just need some little work to be ready.

## 2024-01-18

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* India
* Mariana
* Leo
* Agustina

**Quick updates:**

    * Also changed the expected shape of the `magnetization` vector to better integrate with `hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec`
    * Plan to start working on the same changes for the forward fucntions for dipoles
* Merged the update for the forward of point sources using Choclo: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/422
    * Thanks to Lu for the work!
    * It might be the first Fatiando PR merged from Antarctica! :penguin: 
        * Would make a nice post on social media!
* Opened issue to improve error message while reading a corrupted Oasis Montaj grd file: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/issues/451

* New package: Magali! For processing and inversion of magnetic microscopy. 
    * Currently on my lab org (https://github.com/compgeolab/magali) but want to move to Fatiando. Objections? We talked about this before but just confirming.
    * MSc student Yago will arrive in SÃ£o Paulo in the next month to work on this as his dissertation.
    * Will generate PRs in Harmonica as well (like Euler Deconvolution).
* New article citing Fatiando: https://jurnal.stageofsleman.id/index.php/jsgs/article/download/11/12
    * Mariana sent an invitation to the corresponding author to join us in the community calls
* Promoting [Dominic Kempf](https://github.com/dokempf) to Developer on Pooch:
    * Has been very active and enthusiastic.
    * We need more hands in the project.
    * Leo will email and CC council to invite.
* Add `MAINTAINERS.md` file to repos listing maintainers
    * That file should live in the repo for each package
    * Leo will update the GitHub teams
* India shared and idea for generating regular grids at angles, useful for "diagonal" flight lines
    * It would be nice to see an issue with more details about it
    * One possible implementation would be to generate the grid and then rotate the coordinate system

## 2024-01-04

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

**Participants:**

* Santi
* India 
* Mariana
* Leo

**Quick updates:**

* Santi went to AGU
    * Met Matt Tankersely in person! Matt had a poster, and a lightning talk in the same session as me. Was great to talk about Fatiando and also see his presentation mentioning the same tools.
    * Met Blazej Bucha. He contributed to Boule. Great work on spherical harmonics: https://github.com/blazej-bucha.
    * Lunch with Fernando Perez, Jim (2i2c) and Rowan and Steve (Curvenote)
    * Geolatinas gatherings!
    * Met Yago and Suzana (Yago will start as Master Student with Leo)
    * Met Carlos Alberto Moreno Chaves, from USP.
    * Ines Sanchez Rodriguez, Hydrology. opencollaborationhydrology.com. Got invited to participate in a podcast about open-source. It'll probably be in Spanish.
    * HÃ©lÃ¨ne Le MÃ©vel. Awesome inversions of gravity satelite data before, during and after the eruption of Hunga Tonga.
        * Paper is out: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3156
    * Tasha Snow. CryoCloud: https://www.cryocloud.io/. Great talk about why open science!
        * Intelectual generosity
        * Intelectual humility
        * Right to participate in science (democratizing it)
        * Everyone deserves dignity and respect
        * Open Science is a process, not a product!
    * Project Pythia.
    * Center of Open Science: https://www.cos.io/
    * Folks from NumFOCUS were there: Xarray, Dask, etc. Ryan Abernathey, Deepak Cherian.
    * Nigel Rees. Haven't got the chance to meet him, but he emailed me about the Fatiando poster. Matt had a talk with him.
    * Jiajia Sun. Interested in having magnetic equivalent sources in Harmonica.
    * I gave away a lot of Fatiando stickers. Even in the plane: the student that was sitting next to me knew about it :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
        * Sarai MontaÃ±ez MuÃ±oz
* Faster terrain correction by block averaging.
    * Santi discussed some implementation with Craig before Banff.
    * We kept talking about it with Matt.
    * After AGU I started drafting an implementation: https://github.com/santisoler/harmonica/blob/prism-layer-fast-forward/harmonica/_forward/prism_layer.py
* Plan to start adding kernels in Choclo for magnetic gradiometry
* Discussion on Harmonica Issues for better defaults for equivalent sources:
    * Santi will tackle the removal of the `depth_type`
    * India will tackle the better defaults for `window_size` and `depth`
* Leo: Started playing with spherical harmonics. SHTools is a bit large and overkill when we just want simple synthesis of a low degree model (like a lot of magnetic models). Plus, there is no package I found that can do the inversion part for scattered data (SHTools only does it for grids). I'll need this for class and for some projects so will start coding something and maybe get a student involved. **Should this be part of Harmonica or its own package?** The surface harmonics can be used for other things and the associated Legendre function calculation as well (scipy has it but it wraps an ugly fortran code and the normalization isn't very clear). But otherwise, this fits with the equivalent source stuff in Harmonica.
    * It could live in Harmonica!
* Improving tests for Pooch downloaders:
    * Right now Pooch's tests rely on third-party servers being available when testing
    * If those servers go down, Pooch tests start failing
    * Idea: mock httpservers with `pytest-httpserver` for testing purposes.
    * Keep the current tests, but maybe make them optional
    * We should **open an issue** for creating an sftp server using pytest just to test it
* Design choices for forwards and physical equivalent sources:
    * Merge magnetic forward functions in Harmonica to a single one, that either returns a single array, or a tuple of arrays
        * Those should take a `field` argument that could be `b_e`, `b_n`, `b_u` or `b` for the full vector, required argument.
    * Constructing the equivalent sources takes regular parameters plus the inc,dec of the sources
    * Fitting would be nice as ``
    * Design draft for the `fit` and `predict` methods for the eq mag sources
        ```
        class EquivalentMagSources:
            def __init__(self, ...):
                ...
                
            def fit(self, tfa=None, b_ee=None, ...):
                ...

            def predict(self, coordinates, field):
                ...
            
        eqs = hm.EquivalentMagSources(
            depth=..., 
            inc_sources: float =...,

        )
        eqs.fit(
            tfa=(coordinates, data, weights, inclination, declination),
            b_ee=(coordinates, data, weights),
            b_nn=(coordinates, data, weights),
        )
        b_ee = eqs.predict(coordiantes, data, field="b_ee")
        (b_e, b_n, b_u) = eqs.predict(coordiantes, data, field="b")
        tfa = hm.total_field_anomaly((b_e, b_n, b_u), inc, dec)
        ```
        
* We might want to check if `hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec` work well with inc and dec as floats and amplitude as array.
    * Write tests!
* The mag forward modelling functions take magnetizations as 2d array with each magnetic moment per row. We should change this to accept a tuple with the three components:
    ```
    dipole_magnetic(
        coordinates,
        dipoles,
        magnetic_moments=(magnetization_e, magnetization_n, magnetization_u),
        parallel=True,
        dtype="float64",
        disable_checks=False,
    ): 
    ```
    * This makes it consistent with `hm.magnetic_angles_to_vec` and with how coordinates are handled.
    
* Leo: Trying to find a good magnetic microscopy dataset to add to Ensaio. Will clean up the one we used [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5QD5Z) because it's relatively good with a bunch of well behaved dipoles. Great for running grid-related examples in Harmonica since the data is on a regular grid at constant height from the very start. Would also be good for an Euler Deconvolution example since they're all very close to dipoles.
