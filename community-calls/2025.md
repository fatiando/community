### Notes

Choclo v0.3.2 is out! :rocket:

* Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/changes.html#version-0-3-2
* Includes bugfix for third-order kernels for prisms. The previous implementation was suffering from numerical instabilities (in specific cases) that in particular scenarios could lead to undesired division by zero errors.
* Replace flake8, black, isort for ruff.
* Use zizmor to lint github actions.
* Minor fix to docs deployment: use [`set -e`](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/blob/4d40d32e4e3ecbfbbd5c91a2b56164ecb02895c4/.github/workflows/docs.yml#L156-L157) so the deployment script doesn't fail silently.
* TODO: `set -e` on docs deployments everywhere. Check if we can set it globally. Seems like we can on the command line.

Pooch:

* Reviewing PR on adding type hints to it.

Harmonica:

* Docs are not building due to segmentation fault coming from pyvista.
    * Might worth try this instead: https://vedo.embl.es/
* `magnetic_angles_to_vec` doesn't work with lists. Might be worth adding a conversion in the function. Need to open an issue.

Maintenance:

* TODO: `set -e` on docs deployments everywhere. Check if we can set it globally. Seems like we can on the command line.
* Stop DDOSing Zenodo. Set ENSAIO_DATA_FROM_GITHUB in CI builds to avoid downloading from Zenodo and get it from the GitHub releases instead.

Magali:

* Data in magali has always vertical axis pointing down. This makes it annoying to work with Harmonica's API (also easting and northing doesn't make sense in Magali). The best solution would be to create wrappers fro Harmonica functions that make the correct sign corrections and rename the arguments accordingly.

Verde:

* Thinking again about splitting the package. There is a new function Leo's written for rotating coordinates (useful for defining diagonal dikes). Might be worth having that function elsewhere.

Backing up Fatiando repositories:

* We currently have all Fatiando repos in GitHub. We are keen on considering other git providers where we can back them up (in case something goes bad with GitHub and our organization, considering current situation in the US).
    * [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is a good candidate. Non-profit, community-led, commitment with open-source.
    * They use [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), which is also open-source (anyone can host their own Forgejo instance).
    * We might want to do some research on how to automate backing up our repos:
        * Codeberg has a import feature that allows to bring repos from other services like GitHub.

**Notes**

* Started working on replacing pylint, flake8, isort and black with ruff:
    * Pooch: [#453](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/453)
    * Choclo: [#112](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/112)
* Started using zizmor in some packages:
    * Choclo: [#114](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/114)
    * Harmonica: [#544](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/544)
* Pooch:
    * Maintenance work
        * Drop support for Python 3.7 and 3.8 (due to EOL)
        * Extended support for Python 3.13 (testing on Py 3.13 on Actions)
    * Reviewing some PRs and issues:
        * Add mypy to CI job and type hints for one class [#404](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/404)
        * More informative error message when resolving DOI URLs [#456](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/456)
        * Order of extracted members [#457](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/457)
            * Simpler solution: we could loop over `members` instead of using os.walk and then transform the files to paths, so we keep the same order
            * We might encounter issues with the separator for Windows.
