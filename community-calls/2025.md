**Time:** 17:00 UTC

### Participants

* Leo
* Yago
* Santi

### Notes

Harmonica:

* Segmentation fault in GitHub Actions when plotting in 3D with pyvista
    * It is working now?
    * Seems so! 
* Coverage is marked at 0% by codecov, not sure why

Bordado:

* [v0.1 released](https://www.fatiando.org/bordado/latest/changes.html#version-0-1-0) and on conda-forge. 
* Has most coordinate generation functions from Verde and `block_split` and `rolling_window`. 
* All functions are now better tested, have better argument checks, better argument names, and are n-dimensional (4D grid coordinates anyone?).
* Can start to be used in other projects.
* Ideas:
    * Rename `rng` argument in `random_coordinates` to `random_seed`
    * No need to check if `rng` is `int` or `Generator`, we can just pass the `random_seed` to `Generator(seed=random_seed)`.

Conversation about Github and Codeberg & Forgejo
* OrganicMaps (privacy-oriented open-source Android app for maps) moved to their own Fogejo instance after their GitHub org got blocked. One more case that would make us consider having a backup plan to GitHub.
    * Easiest solution: just push the whole repo.
    * Codeberg allows to migrate repos, with issues and pull requests. Nice to do that once, not to do it daily (as a mirror).
    * Codeberg doesn't provide runners for CI, we would have to maintain our own runners.

Magali:

* Got the source detection working
* Build a benchmark test for the detection based on Gelson's paper
* Idea to build a challenge model for the source detection

Sprints at USP!

* Planning one jointly with SimPEG on first week of September:https://hackmd.io/@leouieda/geosprint2025
* Leo and Yago are planning a small one at USP (just 1 day) this semester still.
* Idea of having a "coding hour" every week at the lab where we code on Fatiando.

## 2025-03-18

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

### Participants

* Gelson
* India
* Santi
* Leo

### Notes

Harmonica:

* Gelson's work on Takahasi's method implementation
    * We can replace the FFT-based method for the dot product with our own Numba functions inside a scipy's LinearOperator.
* Default value for the `damping` in equivalent sources is not the best choice
    * It triggers a non-regularized inversion problem, that might take too long to converge
    * It might be better to set teh default value to a small number (1e-5 for example)
    * Would be nice to add some Notes explaining what happens when you don't set damping.
* Planning v0.8.0 release
    * We can check the milestones to see what we would like to include in this release
    * Is the IGRF issue seeing advances?
    * Changing the default value for the damping would be a good thing to have there.

Pooch:

* Too many requests to doi.org when downloading multiple files from a DOI repository

Revisiting ideas for a non-convoluted inversion framework:

* The old inversion framework in `fatiando`: https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/tree/master/fatiando/inversion
* Would be nice to have something like that to avoid relying on sklearn for solving least squares problems both in Verde and in Harmonica.

**Time:** 17:00 UTC

### Participants

* Gelson
* Santi

### Notes

Harmonica:

* Still fighting with the pyvista issue in the docs: https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/551
    * Tried to pin all package versions to the same ones used the last time that docs built correctly, but no luck...
    * [Pinned packages](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/551/files/45918e7374af3d258b1590bb061f77b8b3932b4f)
    * Exploring Vedo in the meantime. Vedo has a specific class to build prisms: [`Box`](https://vedo.embl.es/docs/vedo/shapes.html#Box)
* Gelson brought back the idea of implementing Takahashi's equivalent sources (Toeplitz matrices + FFTs)
    * Plan to discuss this further next week.
    * Gelson will bring some code so we can take a look at it.

### Notes

Choclo v0.3.2 is out! :rocket:

* Changelog: https://www.fatiando.org/choclo/latest/changes.html#version-0-3-2
* Includes bugfix for third-order kernels for prisms. The previous implementation was suffering from numerical instabilities (in specific cases) that in particular scenarios could lead to undesired division by zero errors. 
* Replace flake8, black, isort for ruff.
* Use zizmor to lint github actions.
* Minor fix to docs deployment: use [`set -e`](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/blob/4d40d32e4e3ecbfbbd5c91a2b56164ecb02895c4/.github/workflows/docs.yml#L156-L157) so the deployment script doesn't fail silently.
* TODO: `set -e` on docs deployments everywhere. Check if we can set it globally. Seems like we can on the command line.

Pooch:

* Reviewing PR on adding type hints to it.

Harmonica:

* Docs are not building due to segmentation fault coming from pyvista.
    * Might worth try this instead: https://vedo.embl.es/
* `magnetic_angles_to_vec` doesn't work with lists. Might be worth adding a conversion in the function. Need to open an issue.

Maintenance:

* TODO: `set -e` on docs deployments everywhere. Check if we can set it globally. Seems like we can on the command line.
* Stop DDOSing Zenodo. Set ENSAIO_DATA_FROM_GITHUB in CI builds to avoid downloading from Zenodo and get it from the GitHub releases instead.

Magali:

* Data in magali has always vertical axis pointing down. This makes it annoying to work with Harmonica's API (also easting and northing doesn't make sense in Magali). The best solution would be to create wrappers fro Harmonica functions that make the correct sign corrections and rename the arguments accordingly.

Verde:

* Thinking again about splitting the package. There is a new function Leo's written for rotating coordinates (useful for defining diagonal dikes). Might be worth having that function elsewhere.

Backing up Fatiando repositories:

* We currently have all Fatiando repos in GitHub. We are keen on considering other git providers where we can back them up (in case something goes bad with GitHub and our organization, considering current situation in the US).
    * [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is a good candidate. Non-profit, community-led, commitment with open-source.
    * They use [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), which is also open-source (anyone can host their own Forgejo instance).
    * We might want to do some research on how to automate backing up our repos:
        * Codeberg has a import feature that allows to bring repos from other services like GitHub.
        * https://codeberg.org/wl/GithubCodebergMirror

### Participants

* Leo

**Notes**

* Started working on replacing pylint, flake8, isort and black with ruff: 
    * Pooch: [#453](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/453)
    * Choclo: [#112](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/112)
* Started using zizmor in some packages:
    * Choclo: [#114](https://github.com/fatiando/choclo/pull/114)
    * Harmonica: [#544](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/544)
* Pooch: 
    * Maintenance work
        * Drop support for Python 3.7 and 3.8 (due to EOL)
        * Extended support for Python 3.13 (testing on Py 3.13 on Actions)
    * Reviewing some PRs and issues:
        * Add mypy to CI job and type hints for one class [#404](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/404)
        * More informative error message when resolving DOI URLs [#456](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/456)
        * Order of extracted members [#457](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/457)
            * Simpler solution: we could loop over `members` instead of using os.walk and then transform the files to paths, so we keep the same order
            * We might encounter issues with the separator for Windows.
