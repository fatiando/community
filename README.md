# Community resources for the Fatiando a Terra project

This repository contains resources for the Fatiando community: rules and
guidelines, meeting notes, a place to organize project wide maintenance, etc.

## Where we hangout 

* [Slack](https://fatiando.org/slack/): Hop on to our chat room to ask questions, 
  leave comments, and reach out to users and developers.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/fatiando): Technical discussion happens mostly in
  the issues and pull requests of our repositories. Make sure you "watch" them
  to get notified and join the `github-activity` channel on Slack.

## Calls and meeting notes

* 🗨️ **Join a call**: https://meet.jit.si/fatiando-a-terra/dev-calls 
* 📜 **Meeting notes & agenda**: https://hackmd.io/@fatiando/development-calls-2022 
* 📅 **Shared calendar**: https://www.fatiando.org/calendar

All our meetings are **open to everyone**!

We meet up **weekly** to discuss project development, get to know each other,
share experiences, and even **code things live** to show our process.
They are a great way to learn more about day-to-day development and get to 
know our global community.
It's absolutely fine to join and just listen to what we discuss
but we welcome participation!

Meeting notes are archived in the `development-calls` folder of this repository.
Please **do not edit these directly**. Use the HackMD link above instead 
(changes there get synced to this repository periodically).

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to any virtual or physical
spaces used by our community.
Please make sure you're familiar with it.

## Guides

:tada: First of all, thank you for considering getting involved in our project!
**Any help/feedback you can provide is greatly appreciated.**

These guides layout the standard processes for contributing to the project,
performing maintenance, establishing authorship, and more:

  project.
* [Authorship Guidelines](AUTHORSHIP.md): how we attribute authorship in
  archives and publications
* [Maintainers Guide](MAINTENANCE.md): procedures for maintenance tasks like
  handling pull requests, making releases, etc.

Please feel free to use these files for your own projects.
