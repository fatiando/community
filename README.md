# Community resources for the Fatiando a Terra project

This repository contains resources for the Fatiando community: rules and
guidelines, meeting notes, a place to organize project wide maintenance, etc.

## Weekly calls (open to everyone)

* 📜 **Meeting notes & agenda**: https://hackmd.io/@fatiando/development-calls-2022 
* 📅 **Shared calendar**: https://www.fatiando.org/calendar

We meet up **weekly** to discuss project development, get to know each other,
share experiences, and even **code things live** to show our process.
They are a great way to learn more about day-to-day development and get to 
know our global community.
It's absolutely fine to join and just listen to what we discuss
but we welcome participation!

See [our contact page](https://www.fatiando.org/contact) for more information
on how to connect. We post links to the join the call and reminders on our
chat rooms so keep an eye out!

Meeting notes are archived in the `development-calls` folder of this repository.
Please **do not edit these directly**. Use the HackMD link above instead 
(changes there get synced to this repository periodically).

## Code of Conduct

## Guides

**Any help/feedback you can provide is greatly appreciated.**

These guides layout the standard processes for contributing to the project,
performing maintenance, establishing authorship, and more:

  project.

  archives and publications

  handling pull requests, making releases, etc.
